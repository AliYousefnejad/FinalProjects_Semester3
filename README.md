# Final Project – Semester 3  
## Data Structures Implementation

This repository contains the final projects for **Semester 3 – Data Structures** course at the **University of Guilan**.  
The projects are implemented in **Python** and focus on the implementation of different tree-based data structures and their traversals.

## Projects Overview

The repository includes the following implementations:

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **Expression Tree** with infix and postfix traversals
- **Tree-based applications for data structure practice**

## Files Description

- `BST_NoteNumber.py`  
  Implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** with basic operations such as insertion, searching, and traversal.

- `Expression_Tree.py`  
  Implementation of an **Expression Tree**, including **infix** and **postfix** traversals for expression evaluation.

- `SecondHandBooks.py`  
  A tree-based system for managing a **second-hand book store**, demonstrating the use of hierarchical data structures.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: **Python**
- Course: **Data Structures**
- Environment: **Console Application**

## How to Run

1. Make sure **Python 3** is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the project files.
3. Open a terminal in the project directory.
4. Run any project file using the following command:

```bash
python BST_NoteNumber.py
python Expression_Tree.py
python SecondHandBooks.py
```
